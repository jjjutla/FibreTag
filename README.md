FibreTag is an iOS app that combines the power of vechain’s blockchain technology with the dual needs of the luxury fashion market: combating counterfeits and promoting sustainability. We utilise NFC technology to provide a comprehensive view of a product's journey from raw materials to the customer and upon purchase, users also receive a unique NFT digital twin to further guarantee authenticity and offer unparalleled transparency.

## Problems Solved
- [85% of fashion's carbon emissions](https://web-assets.bcg.com/1e/23/d9e9792a4988b61e708794baa174/bcg-sustainability-metaverse-in-fashion-opportunity-or-threat-oct-2022.pdf) come from distribution and suppliers; our blockchain record identifies major emitters. 
- By 2023, the [Fashion Industry Charter](https://unfccc.int/climate-action/sectoral-engagement-for-climate-action/fashion-charter) mandates a 50% emission cut for all brands; we assess supply chain data to verify brand compliance. 
- [The USA discards over 2,150 tons of clothing per second](https://wiltonchamber.com/event-detail/sustainability-in-fashion-curating-an-ethically-conscious-closet/#:~:text=Did%20you%20know%20that%20Americans,pieces%20of%20clothing%20per%20second.); our combatting of counterfeits promotes circular fashion economy. 
- Easy on-boarding of users using a walletless Google authentication and fiat payments using Chargebee.

### For Consumers:
- **Proof of Authenticity:** Each NFT serves as a digital certificate of authenticity. WIth counterfeits rampant in the luxury market having an NFT assures the consumer of the item’s genuineness. 
- **Digital Ownership:** The NFT represents digital ownership allowing consumers to showcase their luxury items in virtual spaces such as metaverses or social media platforms
- **Resale Value:** With the NFT, the resale market becomes more transparent. A buyer can verify the item's history, ensuring it's genuine and well-maintained, potentially increasing its resale value.

### For Brands, Manufacturers and Suppliers:
- **Counterfeit Deterrences:** By issuing NFT's brands can significantly deter counterfeiting as replicating physical items wont come with the genuine NFT.
- **Expanding Brand Reach:** By authenticating used luxury items, brands can attract and assure a broader range of customers, including those with lower incomes, thereby widening their market presence.
- **Data Insights:** By tracking the history of products, brands can gain valuable insights to tailor marketing strategies and product launches. Brands can monitor secondary markets such as the resale market, ginning insights into product life cycles, demand and consumer behaviour, prodiving more data.
- **Regulation Compliance:** Allows brands to get compliant with regulations and streamline audits: Fashion Industry Charter for Climate Action (Will be enforced by the end of 2030 to cut emissions in the fashion industry by 50%)
- **Enhanced Brand Image:** Adopting a transparent and sustainable model enhances the brand's image, appealing to the growing demographic of conscious consumers.
- **Market Differentiation:** In a competitive market, being a part of a transparent blockchain system can differentiate a supplier or manufacturer from competitors, potentially attracting more business.
