# FiTag
FiTag is a iOS Luxury Fashion Marketplace powered by Vechain. We guarantee complete transparency from sourcing to sale, offering buyers a unique NFT digital twin with each purchase. Our loyalty tokens provide access to exclusive AR try-ons and early releases. Plus, we streamline brand compliance with upcoming regulations and champion sustainability through our rental model.

### Solved Problems
- [85% of fashion's carbon emissions](https://web-assets.bcg.com/1e/23/d9e9792a4988b61e708794baa174/bcg-sustainability-metaverse-in-fashion-opportunity-or-threat-oct-2022.pdf) come from distribution and suppliers; our blockchain record identifies major emitters. 
- By 2023, the Fashion Industry Charter mandates a 50% emission cut for all brands; we assess supply chain data to verify brand compliance. 
- The USA discards over 2,150 tons of clothing per second; our rental service promotes a circular fashion economy. 
- 21% of digital users (10-25 years) buy fashion just for social media posts; our AR feature lets influencers virtually try on outfits, reducing global shipping.
- Easy on-boarding of users using a walletless Google authentication and fiat payments using Chargebee.
